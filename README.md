# Epidemiological-Modelling-Spatial-modelling-and-management-objectives
MATLAB/Python Project to model spread of disease across several individual locations using spatial kernels. Also forecasted effectiveness of various interventions.

This project examined a system where a disease spreads across several independent locations, who potency for cross infection is determined by a spatial kernel, implemented by the Loc2Dist. script which draws from the locations.mat file. ODE_SIR_model.m runs the main ODE model and Run_Sheet5.m generates the figures used in EpiAssessWorkSheet5.pdf which answers the tasks in the worksheet.
